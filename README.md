- 128x64 white oled screen
- 2 axis joystick<br>
Next up to final parts below the list
- 3D designed body
- charge unit
- battery
- circuit board
# ROAD MAP ⭐
- Figure out how oled screens works, use librarys
- Create basic dot controllable with joystick to oled screen
- create basic snake game
- Test battery and charge unit performence
- Draw and print body
- If arduino memory can hold the whole data, add some picture or gifs
